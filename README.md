The [AsyncAPI specification](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi) allows you to create machine-readable definitions of your asynchronous APIs. It's protocol-agnostic, so you can use it for APIs that work over MQTT, AMQP, WebSockets, STOMP, etc. The specification is heavily inspired on [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) \(fka Swagger\) and it's designed to maintain as much compatibility as possible with it.
